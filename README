FEATURES:
    - open source
    - POSIX multiplatform, should compile on mingw32, works even on big endian platforms(tested on sparc4v)
    - it's plain c, shoul be fast and efficent on low end pc's
    - unicode support (any characters that are not in read_line 2nd and 3rd argument and that return true
      with is_valid(label) function)
    - label arithmetic (I decided to leave it without parentheses since there's no much need for that)
    - rudimentary disassembler(not yet tested on big-endian)
    - loader

TODO:
    - extend for more than 512 instructions
    - add eeprom support for the load
    - fix clocksel hack
    - different syntaxes(for use with c preprocessor for example) (PARTIAL)
    - some kind of BNF
    - test on mingw32

ISSUES:
    -if you get SIGBUS error, it has to do with alignment on your arch, you have to tweak pragma pack()
     in types.h, see http://cmynhier.blogspot.com/2008/10/memory-alignment-on-sparc-or-300x.html
    -there can be problems with poll() on MacOS X < 10.4, see
